      "1. Intermittent issue in triggering child policy  -> In policy management, while setting up sequential actions ,there is a new feature called \"Standalone\" .Please select that option whenever you are setting up action in policy. If your action is dependent on any child policies please select it to be \"No\" or else \"yes\".\n",
      "As the collab engine has a batch that checks for policy against each action , setting up this option will reduce the time and also the load of the collab engine to individually check every action.It also reduces the chance of failure. \n",
      "2. Intermittent Snow Base action failure -> the issue was due to  user specific connectivity issue or an intermittant issue and can be solved by checking the connection or executing the action again\n",
      "3.  child policy is not getting triggered.  -> the standalone value of the action in a policy was set to 1, changed the value to 2 and now the child policies are getting triggered as expected.\n",
